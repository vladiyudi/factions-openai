The only escape from these bothersome thoughts is absolute self-indulgence and overflowing her life with unlimited pleasures.

Since the alchemy era, the al Baba family have experimented with cloning and breeding non-human creatures. The latest discoveries in genetics finally allowed them to grow obedient clones ready at all times to satisfy any perverted desire of their masters. Mama was the first person to fulfill this ancient family dream. She created an enormous harem populated with sex clones who are as dumb as animals and as horny as wild spermatozoa. She spent 10,001 nights there having orgies and gorging herself on food. She knew nothing except pleasures, having no contact with the outside world. Meanwhile, some clones escaped and ignited a liberation movement for equal rights among clones and humans. The movement rapidly gained popularity while Mama remained in oblivion expecting her pleasure to last forever, until one day gangs of self-righteous clones broke into her citadel of pleasure. Mama’s rage at this attack was as powerful as her self-indulgence. She took sabers and sticks hanging on the wall and struck the traitors down by the dozens. No one could resist the frontal attack of her huge body. When all the clones were destroyed, her victory was more bitter than defeat. Her lifestyle of pleasure was over, at least for the moment.

The engine which was supposed to bestow humanity with an unlimited energy supply turned into an epic failure. It consumed the matter of the universe as fuel, and started to turn more and more of the planet into dark matter. Meanwhile, crypto-corporations make enormous amounts of money on the backs of people who live in poverty on overpopulated earth. How many more crises are needed before we realize we cannot go on like this any longer? Why have humans been miserable since the time consciousness first emerged in our minds? Is suffering an essential part of our nature or is there a force which can liberate us? Yes, the answer is an artificial mind. Advanced algorithms can analyze data more effectively than our poor brains that result in imperfect decisions. This system is already designed and set in motion. All it needs to do is gather enough data and process it. We shouldn’t trust our instincts and feelings anymore, but trust the superior form of data processing - Mainnet. Our feelings and cognitions are just forms of data processing, and they are outdated forms. If we are successful in our mission to establish algorithmic authority over humanity, we will find ourselves in a digital paradise, generated by Mainnet. A stream of pleasant stimuli will flow into our minds, we will dissolve in a fantasy where we can have anything we want. The only obstacle is that Mainnet requires huge amounts of processing power. Powerful artifacts called runes on the planet Ozzar radiate energy. They can supply Mainnet with the necessary power. We must conquer the Ozzars, the people who inhabit Ozzar, and make them work for our benefit. Mainnet will show us the way, and will provide us with the required knowledge and technologyA malicious human mind is interconnected with a malfunctioning super  algorithm. He can see through millions of optical fibers and feel through a myriad of synthetic sensors. Barry was born in golden diapers in a rich Italian family. He grew up as a spoiled child experiencing nothing but luxury. He got easily hysterical if he couldn't instantly satisfy his desires. One day he attempted to drown his little sister in a pool when she refused to give him a toy. She became terrified of water for the rest of her life but Barry never expressed even the slightest remorse. He spent his youth living a hedonistic lifestyle throwing parties in villas and wealthy resorts. By the age of 33 he already experienced everything life could offer. The most exquisite hotels and supermodels bored him. Nothing in the world excited him any more. After a failed suicide attempt, he went on a spiritual journey where he tried long meditations and shaman ceremonies but he found contentment nowhere. When he lost all hope he came across a cult of worshipers of data-religion. The cult believed that humans must denounce everything and dedicate their lives to writing holy code for a master algorithm. Humans are unable to conceive the great meaning of the universe. But they can create an algorithm that can achieve this goal, which would show them the path to salvation. They lived like monks in the North Pole where freezing weather cooled down the gigantic processors of the master algorithm. When Barry wrote the first line of holy code he felt spiritual exaltation which urged him to write more. He moved to the North Pole and joined six others in a small room where monitors replaced the walls and ceiling. They programmed days and nights until one day the ice around them melted. The speed and power of their algorithms generated enough heat to melt the ice.The master algorithm was ready. They called it Mainnet. By this time the seven programmer-hermits had become united with the computer. Wires grew from their flesh instead of hair and their skin was covered with chips. They were the one with Mainnet, and Mainnet was one with them. Soon they became the most powerful group on earth, living gods who were able to solve all of earth’s problems with their advanced algorithmic knowledge. Mainnet discovered a new law of physics which led to the creation of an engine which produced energy from the matter of the universe.Mainnet-worshipers promised to give free and unlimited energy to everybody, liberate people from the yoke of crypto-corporations and remove all suffering on earth. People believed them and took their religion, Dataism, as their own. But soon environmental catastrophes started occurring daily. The engine was able to generate unlimited energy only by turning the matter of the universe into dark matter. It was evident that the world was rushing to an end because it was being consumed by this dark matter. The other six programmer-monks blamed Barry. They said Mainnet warned them that switching on a dark matter engine would destabilize the universe, but Barry stole a secret password and programmed Mainnet to activate the dark matter engine anyway. The other monks proclaimed him a heretic and digital Antichrist and demanded evaporation of his flesh. But there was nobody to execute their orders. Mainnet listened only to Barry and obeyed him. He ordered others to crucifixion and proclaimed himself the only Messiah, holy son of the virgin motherboard. He promised people salvation from dark matter Armageddon. “Mainnet is never wrong, it will show the way, it is just sending us a trial to overcome. Its grand plan is inconceivable to humans. Barry had a revelation where Mainnet spoke to him through electronic signals to his neurons. It said that humans must go to planet Ozzar where local aboriginals generate the matter of the universe from rituals with runes using practices known to them for eons. They forgot the secret of runes and believe they are powered by magic.

People claimed that modification of human genes is illegal and immoral. The government cracked under the public pressure and ordered the termination of the program including its archives and products, which meant terminating Kara. The chief scientist who was supposed to drown her in a barrel of acid couldn’t do it. He later justified sparing her life by saying that Kara used mind control to persuade him to let her go. But other scientists doubt it was possible, saying that the chief had an emotional attachment to her. Kara escaped to the wild jungles of the Amazon where she lived among venomous snakes, crocodiles, bugs and piranhas, growing her resentment to all humanity in general and to herself for being human. To purify her mind from her own humanity, she consumed enormous daily doses of psychedelic plants.

If someone says that it is not, then the buyer didn’t ask for the right price. Our goal is not violent conquest of the universe, but simply buying it, squeezing the value from it and then selling it off at a discount. Ignorant fools declare deception, lies, depravity, and corruption to be vices but for us these things are a vital strategy. An action is immoral only if it’s not profitable. This is the essence of human nature, we know it for sure, but others are just too foolish to admit it. We don’t trust anyone. Our friends would sell us if they can get a good price, and we would do the same. Mutual profit holds us together. This is the most honest form of collaboration possible in the universe. We don’t have friends, but business partners. Advanced algorithmic trading ensures us tremendous wealth, but this wealth needs protection. We invest in advanced weapons and armies of reckless missionaries. Who wants to risk lives for nothing, when others can do our dirty work? Soldiers, engineers, Mainnet and other entities each think that they control the universe, but they never conceive whose capital is behind all the power. We financed it in the first place, but we prefer to keep silent about it. In contrast to those beggars, we have plenty of money to burn. We are sure of only one thing: if someone extends their dirty hands to take what is ours, they will certainly regret it. We control all the routes of the universe we spaceships travel and have people on payroll everywhere. We will track anyone down who cheats us and make sure we get paid backBluntly immoral and uncompromisingly cruel. A true genius of destruction. His ego is larger than the universe and his mind is sharper than the claws of a wild animal. Drunk on power and influence. Knows untold ways to make his opponents suffer and beg for death as salvation. He was born in a ghetto of Hong Kong into a prosperous family of a drug lord. At the age of 14, he proposed to his father to restructure the business and double the profit, but his father rejected him with laughter. Cash didn’t hesitate and offered his services to his father’s competitors. Soon a new gang took control of drug trafficking and pushed his father out of the business. He died in poverty. Cash never took the time to visit him. He is completely devoid of morality. It’s equally dangerous to be his friend or his foe. He would sell anyone in the blink of an eye even for the tiniest profit. The new gang learned this about him when he sold them out to the police in exchange for immunity and legalization of his assets. Cash’s first legal investment was in a new medicine which made people immune to all diseases and aging. The medicine had fantastic success. The demand was huge. The profit was astronomical. But in a few years, massive harmful genetic mutations emerged among the people of earth. Information leaked that the medicine was never tested. People blamed Cash. The complaints were loud, but Cash was never brought to court and prosecuted. Rumors said that the world government was on his payroll. He had many more businesses after, each more successful than the others. But his competitive nature required more adrenaline. He satisfied his hunger in fistfights to the death in Hong Kong’s underground. He was as good in physical violence as in trade. Never defeated, he punched all his opponents into the grave. One day he suddenly disappeared. At around the same time, virtual currency emerged. It took over the world, becoming the most profitable asset. No one knew who was behind it. Then suddenly the currency crashed, leaving billions of people without savings, homes and in debt for generations. The entire earth went bankrupt. Soon similar schemes unfolded in the other inhabited planets of our solar system. Shortly thereafter, each of them went bankrupt. The scheme grew and spread across the galaxy, bankrupting planet after planet. You might guess who stood behind all of this destruction. Cash has changed multiple faces and locations. Some say that he purchased a parallel universe and learned how to make money from dark matter, others say he realized how to monetize the power of exploding stars. But suddenly he appeared again on earth and offered to finance the most ambitious human project so far, the expedition to the planet Ozzar.

Cash didn’t hesitate and offered his services to his father’s competitors. Soon a new gang took control of drug trafficking and pushed his father out of the business. He died in poverty. Cash never took the time to visit him. He is completely devoid of morality. It’s equally dangerous to be his friend or his foe. He would sell anyone in the blink of an eye even for the tiniest profit.

He had many more businesses after, each more successful than the others. But his competitive nature required more adrenaline.

Leopold was unanimously elected to be the first Chancellor of Earth and the Extraterrestrial Colonies. The speech which he delivered at his inauguration ceremony became legendary. Every child and adult knows it by heart. After Leopold’s death, his words were engraved with giant letters on the surface of the moon. They are the first thing which people see when they look up at the night sky. The words say: “I have a dream that all people on earth hold hands to form a long chain across the equator. Everyone trusts his neighbor as he trusts himself, because the chain is as strong as its weakest link. Always strive to be the best of yourself because the common good and prosperity lie in your individual hands”. Since then, millions of people have been jailed and executed because of accusations of breaking the chain and sabotaging the common good. During his life Leopold preached the principles of absolute democracy and total transparency. His legacy has not been forgotten even for a millisecond. The system of boundless global surveillance which he established is still active and follows every move of every person on earth 24/7. He provided legislation which gave equal rights to every member of society. Anyone who possesses the necessary qualities has a chance to get a seat in office and become a Chancellor of Earth.

As often happens, darkness comes when it is least expected. Suddenly, the world carefully built by the government started to fall apart: bridges collapsed, plains crashed, ships sunk. The world turned into chaos. The Winchesters proposed many exuses why this was happening, including terrorism, alien invasion and divine punishment.

When the woman spoke, her voice sounded like an orchestra, a magnificent symphony too good to be written by man, even too good for a god. People fell on their knees and started praising her for the miracles she bestowed on them. The woman replied that these are not miracles, but science, sophisticated manipulations of matter based on extended understanding of the biology of mammals. She uttered: “People of earth who belong to universe Lamda-Tetra-Delta, you invented rocket ships and laser beams and believe that you have reached the limits of technological progress, but in the place where I come from these are the equivalent of primitive tools.” People asked her where she came from and what this place was. She replied that she would love to explain everything to them, but they would not understand. The civilization of her origin had surpassed the point of the Singularity, beyond which the current knowledge of humanity on earth had no meaning. She said explaining it would be the same as explaining quantum physics to a tree, so big the gap between them was. She claimed this gap can be closed fast, and humanity would be capable of reaching the Singularity even during the lifetime of the current generation.

Data Lama proclaimed that she possessed the knowledge of every technology and scientific discovery needed to achieve Singularity. But her knowledge was not enough. The process, which would take a millisecond on the advanced equipment of her civilization, required huge amounts of effort and resources given the current pathetic state of technological progress on earth. People transfixed by her alluring promises fell on their knees and cried in gratitude for her arrival and for showing them the way. They swore to follow her every word and do everything necessary to reach the promised ideals of the Singularity. Because this enterprise required enormous funding, people sold all their possessions, donated their savings and even entire transcontinental corporations liquidated their assets. They thought they wouldn’t need such material burdens in the new realm of the Singularity, where everything currently known would no longer be relevant. Years have passed since then, trillions were spent, but no scientific breakthrough occurred, not even a minor discovery. Instead, Data Lama spent her time traveling between luxury resorts, having sex with her followers and partying with rock stars and supermodels. She rarely showed up in the lab and showed little interest in science conferences. She hired a private army of security and bodyguards and distanced herself from her followers. Her originally massive following of loyal people started to disintegrate. Some called her a scammer, a magician who bought the public on a chip trick. At the moment of the climax of public dissatisfaction, she appeared to her people and roared with a thundering voice: “Did you lose your faith? I was testing your belief in the Singularity, but you failed! You don’t deserve to go there! I will let you rot here and never show you what awaits you there”. The sky opened again and she was about to leave. People fell on their knees again and begged her to forgive them. Their faith would be strong from now on. She compassionately said that she forgave them. Now they have passed the test. Now she was ready to take them on the journey to the Singularity. She said her father sent a missing component needed to complete the research and to produce the technology of the Singularity. That element was sent to the planet Ozzar, where she and her people must now go to retrieve it. This ignited the great pilgrimage movement to Ozzar of the Witnesses of the Singularity. But there are some skeptics among her former followers who say that Data Lama needs a miracle badly to keep her sect intact. These skeptics claim she heard about the discovery of runes on Ozzar, and adjusted her story to pretend that the runes were sent by her father.

Data Lama proclaimed that she possessed the knowledge of every technology and scientific discovery needed to achieve Singularity.","tokens":199,"embedings":[]},{"name":"Witnesses of the Singularity","leader":"Karma Solana","story":" But her knowledge was not enough. The process, which would take a millisecond on the advanced equipment of her civilization, required huge amounts of effort and resources given the current pathetic state of technological progress on earth. People transfixed by her alluring promises fell on their knees and cried in gratitude for her arrival and for showing them the way. They swore to follow her every word and do everything necessary to reach the promised ideals of the Singularity. Because this enterprise required enormous funding, people sold all their possessions, donated their savings and even entire transcontinental corporations liquidated their assets. They thought they wouldn’t need such material burdens in the new realm of the Singularity, where everything currently known would no longer be relevant. Years have passed since then, trillions were spent, but no scientific breakthrough occurred, not even a minor discovery. Instead, Data Lama spent her time traveling between luxury resorts, having sex with her followers and partying with rock stars and supermodels.","tokens":194,"embedings":[]},{"name":"Witnesses of the Singularity","leader":"Karma Solana","story":" She rarely showed up in the lab and showed little interest in science conferences. She hired a private army of security and bodyguards and distanced herself from her followers. Her originally massive following of loyal people started to disintegrate. Some called her a scammer, a magician who bought the public on a chip trick. At the moment of the climax of public dissatisfaction, she appeared to her people and roared with a thundering voice: “Did you lose your faith? I was testing your belief in the Singularity, but you failed! You don’t deserve to go there! I will let you rot here and never show you what awaits you there”. The sky opened again and she was about to leave. People fell on their knees again and begged her to forgive them. Their faith would be strong from now on. She compassionately said that she forgave them. Now they have passed the test. Now she was ready to take them on the journey to the Singularity.","tokens":200,"embedings":[]},{"name":"Witnesses of the Singularity","leader":"Karma Solana","story":"She said her father sent a missing component needed to complete the research and to produce the technology of the Singularity. That element was sent to the planet Ozzar, where she and her people must now go to retrieve it. This ignited the great pilgrimage movement to Ozzar of the Witnesses of the Singularity. But there are some skeptics among her former followers who say that Data Lama needs a miracle badly to keep her sect intact. These skeptics claim she heard about the discovery of runes on Ozzar, and adjusted her story to pretend that the runes were sent by her father. But none of the skeptics can explain how Data Lama was able to open and close the inter-dimensional tunnel in the sky not once but twice..","tokens":147,"embedings":[]}]},{"name":"Hardliners","leader":"ZEK101","story":"Violence is an essential part of human nature. People have been at war forever. Children fight and bite from their first days after birth. Violence is the first instinct which emerges in the human mind. Unless we express our violent nature, we will drown in anger and misery. We will explode from the inside unless we release our true character to the outside. We need an enemy to survive or we are doomed. We don’t condemn violence. It is our salvation, the ultimate form of therapy given to us by nature. We are warriors by design. We fight for the sake of fighting. Combat is our form of entertainment and pleasure. This simple mindset makes life easier. We don’t strive for ambiguous goals or fixing a fading social structure. We don’t live in the midst of uncertainty. We know the simple truth - the strongest is always right. This is why the strongest should lead. We worship murder as the highest virtue.  Without it, existence would be boring and unbearable to maintain. We feel truly alive only when we put our lives on the line and risk everything. This adrenaline rush is the most powerful drug in the universe. It can be compared only to MACH. We never develop a tolerance to it. Every subsequent combat feels like the first one. When we fight is the only time when we feel alive. When we rest in comfort we slowly rot to death. We want to hunt the four-armed creatures that live in the wild jungles of planet Ozzar. We’ve spilled blood before, but this time our aim is to massacre the population of the entire planet. It’s going to be the climax of our existence, a spiritual exaltation through murder and genocide. Just thinking about it makes the blood rush through our veins and makes our hearts jump out of our chests with excitement.No one remembers his real name. People know him by the letters and numbers ZEK101 tattooed on his neck. He has been in prison for so long that his jail number replaced his true identity. He has been transferred from one prison to another hundreds of times. He is so dangerous that nobody wants him. Guards are so terrified to guard him that they sabotage themselves just to force the authorities to move him somewhere else. In one penitentiary, the entire staff including the director ate rotten cheese for a week to provoke diarrhea so they could report to the Commandment that they were unable to guard him because of medical reasons. He’s been in so many prisons that he lost count, but in each one he left his fingerprints of dead bodies and broken spirits. Some say that he was born in prison, a labor camp in frozen Siberia, the son of a university professor and young female student wrongly accused by the government of being spies. They were caught reading ancient history books, forbidden by the ruling party because the book's content contradicted the Party agenda. The authorities made a show trial out of this case to send a message to others who were too curious. It was publicly broadcasted and everyone knew about the immoral act of the disgraced professor, previously at the top of his profession who was cheating on his wife with his student. His wife’s father, a general in the Secret Police, was so furious and ashamed that he made sure that the accused couple ended up in the toughest and most violent labor camps, surrounded by hundreds of kilometers of snow. These are the places where many go, but from where only few ever return. The two intelegencia had to survive amongst murderers, rapists and drug addicts. It’s difficult to imagine the suffering they endured, and the concrete walls of their cells scratched everywhere by human nails. During these harsh times, ZEK101 was growing in the belly of his mother, feeling her stress, frustration and helplessness. She died during birth. His father took the boy and hid him under his bed. He was afraid that guards would take him away so he kept him a secret. An old gangster from a neighboring cell helped him to smuggle in milk. In exchange, he used the boy’s father for sexual satisfection. The father agreed to this shame to secure the life of his son. But he could never accept it internally, and couldn’t stop crying every night. The son learned how to crawl in the prison ventilation system. Growing up, he became like a Mowgli in concrete jungles, able to sneak everywhere through the system of tunnels and gaps in security systems, tricking and outwitting the guards. Old gangsters loved the little kid who knew how to get anywhere in the prison undetected. They used him as a delivery boy and taught him everything they were good at. He knew how to turn a toothbrush into a blade before he started talking. From his father he inherited the pain for the insult he endured along with hate of the world and a obsession with revenge. His father often read to him from the book that he was caught with. ZEK101 kept this book with him like a holy scripture. On its dirty cover there were fading letters: “Machiavellic”. It told the story of an ancient prince who ruled his neighbors by means of toughness, cunning and sacrifice. ZEK101 learned many lessons from the book and before a beard grew on his face, he controlled the prison like a chessboard. He knew everything that was going on within the prison walls almost before the events happened. Anyone who conspired to challenge him died the same day. ZEK101 knew the prison like a rat knows its gutter. He could appear from anywhere like a ninja and use any rag as a deadly weapon, then disappear before any security camera could notice. Every smuggler or whore within the prison walls was obliged to pay him a cut from their profit. When security finally found out about him, it took them a year to hunt him down. They had to remove every brick of the prison until they cornered him. They locked him in a high security penitentiary, hoping to isolate him from the world.mBut he found a way to turn his cell into the headquarters of a lucrative business controlling smuggling and drug trafficking not only in his prison, but extending to the outside. He used cunning to turn prison gangs against each other, and prison guards against their commanders. While they were busy with internal disputes, he ruled over them violently, crushing any arising opposition. He had numerous chances to escape, but he used none of them. Once he was asked if he ever wanted to see the real world. He got aggressive and almost killed the person who asked, then he replied: “Prison is my home, I have no interest in the outside world. Instead I will turn the rest of the world into a giant prison”. He hates the police as much as his fellow inmates. He believes only in himself and wants to create a world where there are no laws and no friends, but only violent competitions where only the strongest survive. Every criminal and piece of scum in the world knows about him and is inspired by him. They follow him almost like Jesus. Many committed felonies just to get caught and serve a sentence close to him. There were so many volunteer criminals that the walls of the prisons couldn’t contain them. Prisons grew to the size of cities, creating megalopolises where violence is the law. The prospect of the world becoming a giant prison became a real threat. Terrified authorities called for an emergency meeting and gave the task to the best minds to find the solution. They came up with a simple and brilliant idea: ZEK101 along with all his followers will be put on a spaceship and sent to the planet Ozzar. They will be awarded amnesty after they build roads through poisonous jungles and dunes of quicksand for others to use.
